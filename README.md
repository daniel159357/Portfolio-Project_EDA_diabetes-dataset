# Portfolio-project-EDA-diabetes-dataset

One of the most challenging parts of data cleaning is diagnosing data issues and figuring out HOW to most effectively address them. 
In order to accomplish this, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** can be an extremely useful tool. In this portfolio project, I will walk through an example dataset to demonstrate how EDA can inform the initial data inspection, cleaning, and validation process.
It is important to note that every dataset is different and therefore will require different exploration. EDA is all about following the data, verifying your assumptions, and investigating anything that is unexpected.

The commonly used methods in Python for EDA using pandas and numpy:
- .head()
- .columns
- .info
- .describe()
- .dtypes
- .unique()
- .isnull.sum()
- .isnull().any(axis=1)
- .value_counts())
- .replace()

Visualization via **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn in Python** is performed using pairplot and heatmap to check the features of the scaling, outliers, skew, distribution, and association between features.
